"Preserving Wildlife: A Biodiversity in Crisis" is a project that provides information about various endangered species, their ecological roles, conservation efforts, and ways for visitors to get involved. This website aims to educate visitors about the critical issue of endangered species and the urgent need for their preservation.  With sincere dedication to raising awareness about possible extinction of these animals and the challenges they face in their natural habitats, I hope that through this project, visitors will gain a better understanding of the importance of these essential creatures and become motivated to contribute to their protection. Together, we can make a difference and ensure a sustainable future for all species.
